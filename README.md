# BookShelf
This is a DS & A project created by Ryz Clyd Sabucido and Karsten Gabriel Cabico.
This project is to be submitted to our DS & A instructor.

## How it works:
The user can interact with the bookshelf by running the readerMain class. The project
mainly shows our capabilities for handling ADT.
